## The Verilog Edge Detector

This simulated verilog code implements canny edge detection \\

To run this run the verilogEdgeDetector.v file, which will produce a file named canny2.txt, which can be converted to an image and viewed by running the code in postProccessing

With some adaptation, this can be used to program FPGA's and make a faster canny edge detection experience
